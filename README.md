# Interactive-Scheduler
created with vanilla js + html/css for cis 3990

**Technology:** I am going to teach myself to make an interactive scheduler, which will be an essential function of meet2gether's final product. Probably going to try to use CodyHouse- we'll see if it works out.

**Rationale:** For Meet2Gether, we have to implement an interactive calendar for users to input and adjust their base schedules easily. I will be practicing doing that here.
